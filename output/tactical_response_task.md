Given the details provided in the situation report, the tactical response should aim to neutralize the enemy's operational capability and restore security in the area around the abandoned factory while minimizing risk to friendly forces. Here’s a detailed plan:

1. **Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering**:
   - Deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to conduct overhead reconnaissance. Focus on real-time surveillance to monitor enemy troop movements and any reinforcements.
   - Implement electronic warfare (EW) measures to intercept and disrupt enemy communications, reducing their coordination capabilities.

2. **Isolation of the Battlefield**:
   - Utilize long-range artillery strikes to disable the enemy’s mobile anti-air missile system, specifically targeting its radar and mobility components to diminish air defense capabilities.
   - Conduct a feint operation north of the enemy’s current position, drawing their attention away from the main area of attack. This will disperse their forces and reduce the effectiveness of their defensive posture.

3. **Direct Assault with Combined Arms**:
   - Launch a ground offensive combining infantry, armored units, and close air support:
     - The main infantry force, supported by armored personnel carriers (APCs), will advance from the west towards the factory to engage enemy infantry and prevent them from establishing a fortified position.
     - Armored units, including main battle tanks, will flank from the south to engage and neutralize the enemy T-90 tanks.
     - Close air support will be on standby to strike pre-identified targets once the mobile anti-air threat is neutralized. Prioritize strikes on enemy command centers and logistics to disrupt further enemy operations.
   
4. **Establishment of Security and Defensive Positions**:
   - Following the assault, quickly establish defensive positions to secure the area against possible counterattacks.
   - Deploy additional air defense units to protect the newly captured territory from potential aerial threats.
   - Initiate patrols and set up checkpoints to maintain control and monitor for any insurgent activity.

5. **Post-Operation Actions**:
   - Conduct damage assessment and rapid repair of key facilities in the factory area to enable their use for future operations.
   - Begin psychological operations, including leaflet drops and broadcasts, to undermine enemy morale and encourage defection or surrender.
   - Set up a forward operating base near the area to facilitate continued operations and logistics support.

**Justification**:
This plan leverages technological superiority and tactical deception to reduce the enemy’s effectiveness and protect friendly forces. By isolating the battlefield, friendly forces can manipulate enemy movements and create favorable conditions for a decisive assault. The combination of direct and indirect tactics ensures the disruption of enemy capabilities while maximizing the security and effectiveness of friendly forces.

**Potential Outcomes**:
- Successful neutralization of enemy threats around the factory.
- Establishment of control over the strategic location, preventing its use by enemy forces.
- Minimal casualties and material loss for friendly forces, preserving combat effectiveness for future operations.

This response, if executed correctly, will degrade the enemy's operational capabilities sharply and secure a critical area, ensuring operational flexibility and security for ongoing and future missions in the region.
