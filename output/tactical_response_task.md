Given the multi-faceted threat in the Ciutat Vella area, a comprehensive and coordinated counter-operation is necessary to neutralize the threat while minimizing risk to friendly forces and civilians. The proposed tactical response plan consists of the following key actions:

1. **Electronic Warfare Operations**:
   - **Objective**: Jam and disrupt drone communications and control signals to blind enemy surveillance capabilities.
   - **Execution**: Deploy mobile electronic warfare units equipped with signal jamming technology. These units will focus on scrambling the drone communications within the city's airspace, particularly over critical infrastructure areas.
   - **Justification**: Reducing enemy's real-time intelligence capacity will decrease their operational effectiveness and response time, providing our forces with an element of surprise.
   - **Outcome**: Effective disruption of drone operations, reducing the accuracy of enemy intelligence and potentially causing drone loss or disorientation.

2. **Armored Vehicle Engagement**:
   - **Objective**: Neutralize enemy armored capabilities to prevent rapid movement and the establishment of control points.
   - **Execution**: Deploy anti-tank guided missile teams at strategic points which have cover and good visibility on the likely routes of the armored vehicles. Simultaneously, use drone data to track and predict vehicle movements.
   - **Justification**: Taking out armored vehicles will significantly degrade the enemy's firepower and mobility, reducing their ability to project force and respond quickly to developments.
   - **Outcome**: Destruction or incapacitation of enemy armored vehicles, slowing enemy maneuvers and reducing their combat effectiveness.

3. **Infantry Unit Counter-Operations**:
   - **Objective**: Disrupt and dismantle enemy infantry operations, ensuring control of the urban environment.
   - **Execution**: Conduct a series of coordinated small unit ambushes and raids targeting enemy infantry patrols. Utilize urban terrain to friendly advantage, employing sniper teams for overwatch and close-quarter combat units for engagements.
   - **Justification**: By engaging infantry units in a manner that uses the complex urban terrain to our advantage, their ability to maintain control over the region will be compromised.
   - **Outcome**: Reduced enemy foot soldier effectiveness and morale, disrupting their operational capacity and command structure.

4. **Civilian Safety and Collateral Damage Mitigation**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure the safety of civilians and minimize damage to infrastructure.
   - **Execution**: Prior to operations, disseminate information to civilians about safety zones and emergency evacuation routes. Use precision engagement tactics to strictly limit engagements to non-civilian areas and avoid historical landmarks.
   - **Justification**: Maintaining civilian safety and preserving infrastructure are paramount to sustaining public support and minimizing the strategic consequences of urban combat.
   - **Outcome**: Preservation of civilian life and infrastructure, and maintained public support for friendly operations.

5. **Continuous Reconnaissance and Adaptability**:
   - **Objective**: Maintain situational awareness and adapt tactics as necessary.
   - **Execution**: Utilize drones, informants, and reconnaissance teams to continuously gather intelligence on enemy positions and tactics, adjusting our operations accordingly.
   - **Justification**: The dynamic urban environment and the possibility of enemy adaptation require a flexible approach to operations.
   - **Outcome**: Sustained tactical superiority through informed and responsive operations.

This tactical response plan is designed to effectively counter the threat in Ciutat Vella by disrupting enemy capabilities across multiple domains while ensuring the preservation and safety of civilian lives and infrastructure.
