The tactical response must be multi-threaded, focusing on neutralizing threats while minimizing risks to friendly forces and civilians. Here's the strategic approach based on the given situation report:

1. **Enhanced Surveillance and Intelligence Gathering:**
   - Deploy UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to increase surveillance over the operation area, particularly focusing on the armored vehicles and artillery units. This ongoing surveillance will help monitor enemy movements and readiness, updating real-time threat assessments.
   - Employ SIGINT (Signal Intelligence) capabilities to intercept communications, which might give insights into enemy plans or state of morale.

2. **Armored Vehicle Neutralization Plan:**
   - Given their strategic positioning and heightened state of alertness, a direct assault may be high-risk. Instead, precision-guided munitions from air support should be considered to disable these vehicles. Targeting should be timed based on intelligence to hit when these vehicles are least covered by infantry.
   - Simultaneously, deploy anti-armor squads using the natural terrain for concealment to approach and engage these vehicles with anti-tank guided missiles.

3. **Infantry Engagement Strategy:**
   - Small, mobile infantry teams should be used to engage enemy infantry squads. These teams, equipped with night vision and thermal imaging technologies, can exploit the sparse vegetation and terrain undulations to close in on enemy positions under the cover of darkness or during low visibility conditions.
   - Use of suppressive fire from light machine guns could pin down the enemy infantry, reducing their ability to maneuver and support their armored vehicles effectively.

4. **Artillery Unit Countermeasures:**
   - Counter-battery fire should be prepared to engage the artillery units once their precise locations are confirmed. This action will be crucial to mitigating their offensive capabilities.
   - In tandem, deploy electronic warfare units to jam the enemy's communication and targeting systems, impairing their coordination and response times.

5. **Civilian Safety and Urban Area Security:**
   - Establish clear communication lines with local civilian leadership to ensure civilian areas are evacuated or shelters are identified in urban centers close to military operations.
   - Secure key infrastructure and transportation routes to prevent their use by enemy forces and ensure they can support friendly operations. This involves setting up checkpoints and regular patrols.

6. **Flexibility and Adaptation in Operational Planning:**
   - The operation command must remain flexible and ready to adapt the tactics based on real-time intelligence and ground reports. Quick reaction forces should be on standby to exploit sudden opportunities or respond to unexpected threats.

7. **Post-Combat Actions:**
   - Once the hostile threats are neutralized, initiate peace-keeping and security operations to maintain control over the area. Engage in community support activities to rebuild trust and ensure long-term stability.

The proposed response strategy balances offensive actions with protective measures for non-combatants and considers the complex environment of the operation area. By prioritizing intelligence and using technological advantages, the response aims to efficiently neutralize threats with minimal casualties and collateral damage, setting the stage for a successful longer-term peace and stability operation in Algeciras.
