GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT:
- **Coordinates and Location:** 36.969837, -1.927114, Central Térmica Litoral de Almería, Carboneras, Andalucía, Spain
  - **Terrain Type:** Mediterranean coastal region
  - **Tactical Implications:** The coastal terrain provides limited routes for large-scale military movements due to its narrow corridors and urban regions. This configuration benefits defensive operations and restricts vehicle movement. Proximity to major urban centers and infrastructure such as ports enhances logistical support for sustained operations. High visibility and open areas around the coastline increase the tactical requirement for camouflage and fortifications.
