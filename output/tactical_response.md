**Tactical Response Plan: Convergence of Threats Near Abandoned Factory**  

**Objective:** To neutralize the threats posed by the Infantry Squad, T-90 Battle Tanks, and the Mobile Anti-Air Missile System while ensuring the safety of friendly forces and maintaining operational integrity.

### Step 1: Intelligence Gathering and Surveillance
- **Action:** Deploy Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for real-time reconnaissance.  
- **Justification:** UAVs can hover at a safe altitude to collect intelligence on the position of the infantry squad and the mobile anti-air missile system without risking manned aircraft. Utilizing thermal imaging will help identify the locations of these threats.
- **Outcome:** Enhanced situational awareness will allow for informed decision-making regarding potential engagement and troop movements.

### Step 2: Ground Force Preparation
- **Action:** Position ground forces, including an anti-tank team equipped with guided missile systems and infantry support, in concealed locations beyond the effective range of the T-90 tanks and the mobile SAM.  
- **Justification:** This setup will ensure that the infantry squad can be engaged if they make a move towards our forces while minimizing exposure to enemy fire from the tanks and anti-air systems.
- **Outcome:** Ground forces will be ready to respond quickly to threats, while the tactical advantage of concealment helps mitigate risks.

### Step 3: Coordination with Air Assets
- **Action:** Engage with air support units to plan a multi-phase strike, utilizing smokescreens and decoys to distract the mobile anti-air system.  
- **Justification:** Implementing smokescreens will obscure enemy visuals, and decoy flares will draw the attention of the anti-air system away from the main strike force, allowing for precision air strikes on the T-90 tanks.
- **Outcome:** The combination of ground and air attack can potentially disable the tanks while mitigating the risk from anti-air defences.

### Step 4: Engage with Tactical Echelons
- **Action:** Upon precision strikes on T-90 tanks, coordinate an infantry advance to engage the positioned squad in the woodlands.  
- **Justification:** Following the suppression of armored threats, infantry can move in to seize control of the factory with air cover eliminating any lingering threats.
- **Outcome:** Success in this operation ensures control over key terrain and neutralizes enemy forces without incurring significant casualty rates on our side.

### Step 5: Post-Engagement Assessment
- **Action:** Conduct a detailed evaluation of threat elimination and establish secure perimeters around the factory for friendly forces.  
- **Justification:** Assessment of enemy casualties and positions will provide intelligence on further enemy actions, while securing the area prevents potential counterattacks.
- **Outcome:** A secure area allows for further operational planning and safeguarding against any residual threats or reinforcements to adversarial units.

### Conclusion
By implementing these steps, we will effectively address and neutralize the threats posed by the infantry squad, T-90 tanks, and the mobile anti-air missile system. This well-coordinated response maximizes the efficacy of our resources while ensuring the safety of our personnel and achieving mission objectives. The successful execution of this tactical plan provides a pathway to securing strategic assets and maintaining operational superiority in the area.
