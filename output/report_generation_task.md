------------------------------------------------------------------- PRIORITY THREATS (Immediate Attention Required) -------------------------------------------------------------------  
1. **FOE_Vessel_1**: Patrol Craft - **35.9031N, 14.5185E**  
   - Threat: Exhibiting aggressive maneuvers toward FRIEND assets.  
   - Capability: Armed with anti-ship missiles.  
   - Activity: Approaching FRIEND vessels at high speed.

2. **FOE_Vessel_2**: Supply Ship - **35.8950N, 14.5110E**  
   - Threat: Transporting supplies likely intended for hostile operations.  
   - Capability: Enhanced storage capability for weapons.  
   - Activity: Stationary but monitoring FRIEND activities.

3. **UNKNOWN_Craft_1**: Unmarked Skiff - **35.8957N, 14.5161E**  
   - Threat: Potential smuggling or reconnaissance operation.  
   - Capability: Fast-moving, armed with small-caliber weapons.  
   - Activity: Circling FRIEND vessels without identification.

------------------------------------------------------------------- UNKNOWN ENTITIES (Requiring Intelligence Collection) -------------------------------------------------------------------  
- **UNKNOWN_Craft_2**: Unidentified Vessel  
  - Why Unknown: Lack of transponder or identification signals has raised alert levels.  
  - Recommended Action: Initiate aerial reconnaissance and maritime surveillance operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------- TACTICAL SITUATION -------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Terrain**: Shallow waters with diverse underwater obstacles, favoring FRIEND maneuverability.  
**Environment**: Clear skies with good visibility, slight sea swell, operational window favoring naval engagement.  
**Civilian Considerations**: Significant civilian activity in immediate vicinity poses collateral damage risk.  
**Strategic Assets**: Nearby coastline with logistics support and potential evacuation routes.

------------------------------------------------------------------- INTELLIGENCE GAPS -------------------------------------------------------------------  
- Identity and purpose of UNKNOWN_Craft_2 still unknown.  
- Lack of real-time satellite imagery of FOE movements impacts assessment reliability.  
- Recommended collection priorities include enhanced ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------- BOTTOM LINE -------------------------------------------------------------------  
Immediate action is required to assess and neutralize high-priority threats while ensuring civilian safety in operational area.
